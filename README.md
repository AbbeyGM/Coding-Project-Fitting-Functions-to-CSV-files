# Coding-Project-Fitting-Functions-to-CSV-files
This program was created in response to the following challenge:

"You have a CSV file with x and y values. Write a program that reads the csv file and creates an ordered list for both the x and y values and then plots them. The program will then prompt the user what type of function to fit to the x and y values and the options should be 'line, exponential and quadratic' and then the program will perform the fit and product a second plot with the fitted values and print the R^2 parameters.
For the project to meet the requirements it has to contain python functions (for plotting and CSV data extraction as an example) that are well commented, it should use at least one external python library (such as matplotlib or numpy)"



**The Code was initially generated using chatGPT and visualised in VSCode**

**Python version used**: 3.7.1, 

**External libraries required:** numpy, matplotlib and scipy


Below is an example of the output:
